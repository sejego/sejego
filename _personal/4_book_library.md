description: Web book library made with JS
---

This is a JS project done as a part of The Odin Project's [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/library). The books are stored in user's browser's local storage (if present) and all entries are saved. In this project, I also tried [Almond.css](https://github.com/alvaromontoro/almond.css) for the first time, as it is quite simple to use and makes simple websites look more modern.

### Built with:
 * HTML
 * [Almond.css](https://github.com/alvaromontoro/almond.css) for CSS styles
 * JavaScript
 * localStorage [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Storage_API/Using_the_Web_Storage_API)
