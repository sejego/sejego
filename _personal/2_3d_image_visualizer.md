title: 3D Image Visualizer
description: 3D image visualizer desktop app made with PyQt
---

3D Image Visualizer is a Desktop app written in Python using PyQt framework. The idea of the app is that it 
loads CSV or HDF5 files containing [Depth maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth_map) or [point cloud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_cloud) images.

When importing depth map images, the point cloud images are automatically generated from them as well. The configuration (filtering by Z-coordinates) can be saved in YAML file and exported later to apply on a point cloud.

The front-end of the app was designed in Qt Creator software, which then was autogenerated in python file. The rest was written in Python. Images are visualized in Matplotlib (2D and 3D plots). The app features a reset feature - all changes made to point cloud can be reverted.

The app is packaged in *.deb* file that can be installed in Linux-compatible platforms and run natively.

This app was written in just 1 day from scratch.
