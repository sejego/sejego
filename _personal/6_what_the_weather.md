title: What the weather?
description: A weather app that reports current/forecasted weather
---

This minimalistic weather app was created with vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS as a part of [The Odin Project](https://theodinproject.com). Main aim of this project was to learn about fetching, API, promises and Webpack. The weather app fetches the data from OpenWeather API, processes it and display neatly in the app. The front-end is realised in pure HTML and CSS with responsive features. App is deployed on Github Pages.
